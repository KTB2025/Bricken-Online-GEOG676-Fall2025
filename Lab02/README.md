## Assignment Overview

This assignment practices core Python skills such as working with lists, loops, and basic arithmetic operations. The task includes solving three problems using either `for` or `while` loops to manipulate list data.

---

## Tasks

1. Understand Python variables and functions.
2. Work with **lists** and apply loop-based logic to solve arithmetic problems.
3. Practice using `for` and `while` loops.
4. Submit code using GitHub.

## Problem Breakdown

### Part 1 — Multiply All Numbers in a List
part1 = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096]

Solution: A for loop was used to iterate and accumulate the product.

### Part 2 — Add All Numbers in a List
part2 = [-1, 23, 483, 8573, -13847, -381569, 1652337, 718522177]


Solution: A while loop was used to iterate through the list and compute the sum.

### Part 3 — Add Only Even Numbers from a List
part3 = [146, 875, 911, 83, 81, 439, 44, 5, 46, 76, 61, 68, 1, 14, 38, 26, 21]


Solution: A for loop with an if condition checking num % 2 == 0.
